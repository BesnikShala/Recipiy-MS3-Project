# Recipiy | Milestone Project 3

Recipiy is an online recipe site whereby users can view recipes to use freely. They can also sign up and use the features of being able to upload their own recipes or simply just save them to their own personal page for a later date. The aim is for returning customers to be able to use this on many occasions whether it is making a simple lunch or a special dinner.

<a name="user-stories"></a>

## User Stories

### As a First Time User:

* I want to have a reason of why I would want to register an account.
* I want to be able to search for specific recipes if they exist.
* I want to be able to navigate easily through the site.
* I want to be able to view this site on any device.
* I want to search for specific ingredients within recipes.
* I want to be able to view a range of different recipes.

### As a Site Owner:

* I want to be able to edit or delete any pre-existing collections.

* I want my users to be informed correctly if any allergens are present in the recipes. 
* I want to encourage everyday usage of the site, something which can be used by people frequently.

## Design

* Colour Scheme
    * I have kept a very simple and clean look to the page with not much colour. This is very common and wide spread with many recipe sites.
    The simplicity means users can focus on the imagery and then also on the information. I have used a white background to enforce this as
    it emphasises on the imagery and the information displayed. 

* Imagery
    * The imagery used by myself are mainly professional images taken from pixels and unsplash. The users have the option to upload their own
    images to their recipes via a url link. This means the main page recipe images are subject to continuos change. The images throughout are
     very important to user experience as they are the main selling point of the recipe. Without an image the card in the home page is very
     bland along with all the other pages. The images are key when using a modern styling and white backgrounds as they stand out and become 
     a feature themselves. 

     The other visual parts are the titles and headers which have also been styled to a minimalistic look to provide a sense of elegance to the
      page. The images and the information needs to take center stage in my opinion which is the reasoning behind the styling and imagery. The 
      food needs to be attractive and presentable and then the information needs to stand out and be easy to read and follow. 

##

* Wireframes
    The wireframes provided are designed for computer, tablet and Mobile displays. The simplicity of layout doesn't offer much differences between
    and tablet. The wireframe initial design changed slightly as I realised the main home page cards were too small/clutered to hold all the
    information of the recipes and images. A new page was created to house these when a user chooses to view the recipe via a link. The form and
    registration pages also have minor changes from the intitial design.

## Features

* Register an Account with Recipiy

    * A user can view recipes without creating an account. However they will receive more features if they do so. A user can easily register an 
    account via the nav-link. The passwords are hashed for security and there is a confirmation process for the passsword to make sure there are
    no spelling mistakes. A flash message will appear if they have correctly registered an account.

* Log In and Out of Recipiy 

    * Once a user has created an account they can log in and out of their account easily. They are npotified if they have incorrectly entered a 
    password or username. The message does not hint whether the username or password is incorrect for anyone trying to hack another user's details.

[CRUD] Features Implemented

* View Recipes

    * Users can view recipes whether they have an account or not. The recipe cards are displayed on the home page for users to view the image, name
    and description. They then have the option to click on view recipe to view the full information on a separate page.

* Add Recipes
    
    * Existing users have the option to add their own recipes to the page. This is a feature which would encourage users to register with Recipiy,
    to have the option to upload their own recipes. This can be to store their recipes they may have or simply to share their unqiue recipes with
    others.

* Update Recipes

    * An existing user is able to upate their own recipes which they have uploaded. This is to amend any errors or it can be to improve a recipe.
    Whatever the reason may be this feature is available only to the user who created the recipe, so other users cannot alter any recipe.

* Delete Recipes

    * This feature is only available to the user who created the recipe, there is an option for the user to delete the recipe. 

* Search Recipe

    * A search bar on the home page which allows users to search recipes based on keywords within the title or description. I have also made
    ingredients a part of the keywords too if users want to search by ingredient. 

* View Recipe

    * Users have the option to view recipe cards in the home page which display brief information about the recipe. If they want to view the full
    recipe they can click on the link which takes them to a new page whereby they can view the full recipe details and cooking instructions.
